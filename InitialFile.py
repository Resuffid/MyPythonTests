# Types of variables

a = str(3)      # text
b = int(3)      # integer
c = float(3)    # real

# To check the type of variable you use command print(type(a))

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(type(a))

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
